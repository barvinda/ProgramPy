#WebMap

A script displaying points of different volcanoes, in the US, on a map, using folium and pandas.

Experience with:
  1) Using folium to generate a map, and add different aspects on the map. E.g. Markers (with different colours), layer control and hover
  2) pandas to read the data and assign data to vairables inside the script.
  3) Using the zip function to read multiple lists at once.
  
Included; 
  data.json: data of all the Volcanoes
